As mentioned in the last IT Thursday, we’re introducing a React training program.

The aim of this program is to help individuals get up to speed in React JS with TypeScript. The core concepts of React will be covered within a one-month period.

The challenge is to build a web application that interacts with a RESTful API and allows users to perform CRUD operations utilizing ReactJS, TypeScript, Formik or react-hook-form and RxJs.

Prerequisite: Good understanding of JavaScript and web development principles

API: https://procom-interview-employee-test.azurewebsites.net

Week 1: Walking Skeleton
•	Create the TypeScript React Project (with Create React App template)
•	Add MUI and Axios
•	Analyze the API and come up with an overall React app skeleton.
•	Create Employee list component - utilize useState, useEffect hooks

Week 2: Start CRUD components
•	Create component for Employee create
•	Add Routing
•	Implement form library – Formik or react-hook-form (Bonus for learning both, create two versions of form components with each library)
Week 3: Form Validation and backend integration
•	Add components for employee edit and delete
•	Implement form validation with Yup
•	Integrate all the api calls and handle backend errors

Week 4: State management and Performance optimization
•	Implement RxJs for state management. Prevent prop-drilling
•	Add memoization utilizing useCallBack() and useMemo()
•	Optimize performance, component structure and prevent memory leaks
•	Code cleanup and Review


Desired outcomes and learnings:
•	Full TypeScript utilization - strongly typed variables, functions and components
•	Hooks are everything – you need to know exactly how they work
•	Think about the user when building UI elements
•	Design components with render cycles in mind. Prevent wasted render cycles 
•	Separation of concerns between components and services
•	Identify common components and re-use
•	Monitor browser console and network tab. Project should be error free and should not have any duplicate api calls
